# heroPanel

A World of Warcraft addon for the **Ascension WoW · Conquest of Azeroth** realm
(3.3.5a / WotLK client) that reskins and repositions the objective trackers:

* the default quest tracker (`WatchFrame`)
* the Mythic+ tracker (`MythicPlusObjectiveTracker`, from `Ascension_MythicPlus`)

heroPanel is standalone. It reads and writes only its own SavedVariables
(`HEROPANEL_DB`), never hooks game logic with raw overwrites, and never touches
protected frames while the player is in combat.

## Status

**Phase 1 — foundation.** Move, lock and rescale work. Visual skinning, the
options panel and per-line text/colour handling are not implemented yet.

| Phase | Scope | State |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Addon skeleton, frame discovery, conflict detection, move/lock/scale, shared helpers | done |
| 2 | Panel skin — background, border, radius, backdrop texture | planned |
| 3 | Text — fonts, per-state colours, header chrome, collapse caret | planned |
| 4 | Options panel, M+ chest tiers and timer chrome | planned |

## Installation

Copy the `heroPanel` folder into your WoW installation's
`Interface\AddOns` directory, so that `Interface\AddOns\heroPanel\heroPanel.toc`
exists. Restart the client or `/reload`.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/hp lock` | Lock both trackers in place |
| `/hp unlock` | Unlock both trackers — drag with the left mouse button |
| `/hp scale <watch\|mplus> <0.5-1.5>` | Set a tracker's scale |
| `/hp reset [watch\|mplus]` | Clear saved position and scale |
| `/hp status` | Report which frames were found and hooked |
| `/hp debug` | Toggle debug chat output (off by default) |

Unlock, drag a tracker with the left mouse button, and the position is saved.
Scale is 0.5–1.5 in 0.1 steps; it moves into the options panel in Phase 4.

## Compatibility

heroPanel installs its own hooks regardless of what else is loaded. If **DeModal**
or **ElvUI** is detected it prints a single warning at login, because both of
those also want to control the tracker frames — running two of them at once
produces fighting hooks. heroPanel does not disable anything on your behalf.

## Development notes

* **Client API is 3.3.5a only.** No modern WoW API.
* **`WatchFrame` is protected.** `SetPoint` / `Show` / `Hide` / `SetMovable` /
  `SetScale` / `EnableMouse` on it must go through `ns.RunWhenSafe`, which runs
  immediately out of combat and otherwise defers to `PLAYER_REGEN_ENABLED`.
* **Never overwrite game scripts.** Use `ns.HookScript` (hooks if a handler
  exists, sets only when the slot is empty) and `hooksecurefunc` for global
  functions, to avoid taint.
* **`MythicPlusObjectiveTracker` may not exist at `ADDON_LOADED`.** It is polled
  by `ns.PollForTracker`, which backs off and gives up rather than spinning.
* **Timers go through `ns.After`.** `C_Timer` is not present on every 3.3.5a
  client, so `ns.After` falls back to an `OnUpdate` queue.
* **Holding a position on `WatchFrame` needs three measures**, because the
  client re-anchors it from more than one place: removal from
  `UIPARENT_MANAGED_FRAME_POSITIONS`, a `hooksecurefunc` on
  `UIParent_ManageFramePositions`, and a `hooksecurefunc` on the frame's own
  `SetPoint`. Positions are stored as UIParent-space offsets from `TOPLEFT`,
  not as whatever anchor the frame happened to be using.
* **Frame-tree walks are throttled.** `ns.NewTreeScanner(frame, callback, opts)`
  drives passes from a shared `OnUpdate` accumulator, capped at ~10 per second.
  Use it instead of writing per-frame `OnUpdate` handlers.
